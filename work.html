								<exphead>Dublin Public Library</exphead>
								<expdate> June 2010 - Present</expdate>
								<h6> I volunteer twice a year at the Friends of the Dublin Library's book sales.  The book sales occur in September and December and I help them straighten and sell books.  For the Friends of the Dublin Library, I helped them collect, categorize, and price books for their semi-annual book sales.  I also created flyers on the computer that are printed and advertised at their book sales.  I am also a part of the Teen Advisory Group (also called TAG) and I have been a part of it since my freshman year in high school.  I attend monthly meetings where we plan events for teens and help improve the library.  We organized an Anamania party in honor of the library's Japanese summer theme.  During the summer I volunteered twice a week at the Summer Chill Zone to help children from ages 7-10 to learn arts and crafts and perform fun science experiments.  During the school year of October 2012-May 2013 I volunteered at LEGO Club as a LEGO leader, helping my group of kids practice different skills assembling LEGOs and ensuring that they stay on task.  Throughout the summer I also was a part of RAP crew where I helped children ages 18 months to 4 years old and their parents enjoy programs of book readings, arts and crafts, music, and play time.</h6>
